    <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite food is Chicken mandhi.The reason many people enjoy chicken mandi is due to its delicious and complex flavour profile. The chicken is typically marinated with a blend of spices, including cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and black lime, which gives the dish its distinctive taste. The slow-cooking process allows the Flavors to meld together, resulting in a tender and aromatic dish. It's often served with a side of flavourful rice, making it a satisfying and hearty meal.
